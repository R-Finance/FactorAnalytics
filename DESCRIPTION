Description: A package of functions that may be used to calculate style weights using an asset class style model as described in detail in Sharpe (1992).  The use of quadratic programming to determine a fund's exposures to the changes in returns of major asset classes is usually refered to as "style analysis".
Depends: R (>= 2.9.0), PerformanceAnalytics (>= 1.0)
